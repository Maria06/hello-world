# hello-world
This is my first Github repo that i created .
I clone the project form the git using the command from the terminal by 'git clone url of the project'
I saw the changes that i made by the command 'git status'
I add the changes of the file by 'git add fileName'
I commit the changes by pushing in to git by 'git commit -m ""'
Then need to add the remote add origin by 'git remote add origin https://github.com/Maria06/hello-world.git'
Then we need to push to git by 'git push -u origin master'
